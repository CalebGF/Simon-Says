3. The player must repeat the signal by clicking on the corresponding color lens.
4. If the player clicks the correct color, Simon adds one more color to the sequence.
5. The player must then repeat Simon's sequence from the first color and continue testing their memory skills.
6. The game progresses to higher levels as the player successfully repeats the sequence.
